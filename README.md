# elm-colormap
Map a set of coordinates, intensity pairs to a colormap.

Useful for two dimensional plots (scatter plots, heatmaps, any cluster vis) and any form of cartography.

## Colormaps
The selection will be opinionated, based on my very limited experience in physics.
Colormaps are a field of study in their own.

## Colorblind-ness
This is going to be tricky, but it's 2016 and it's not ok to be excluisve.
